This project was done to work on GPT 2 model for text generation. I created a dataset from shakespeares work of over a million tokens to train a model for text generation. the code was influenced by several online sources and was able to generate the following text:

0: The man who devil calls my name has been made acquainted with my
spirits. I am one. -Wilt thou not know? He is so bold as to go way?
That he has met me there. [Exeunt. ] And have such a sense of courage
and will to meet me. [Exeunt. ] I know not what I can do. What I can
do is to go the way. I never have dared to be honest with him, but what I
have done, I will never do. [Exeunt. ] I dare not touch him. I do not
fear for my life; I only fear for my soul. Now, I come, and will never
be honest. I have been fair, honest, honest to both. I did give him money
but at a very high rate. He never spoke of his having done, and he never
answer'd, unless it was his purpose to deceive me. He nevered to speak
of me; he never did anything he wished to tell me. [Exeunt. ] I have
never met him, and he was a gentleman; he never stole me for his money.
I have no doubt that he was justly taken; he had no one else whom he knew,
nor did he know the other; he had no knowledge of him when I was


1: The poet and printer of Hamlet, and of William Shakespeare, who, last
year at Calais, with all the other writers and musicians, went to France,
and after a theatre, were met for dinner by a number of men; and company
were merry all night, laughing, talking, smiling. A little while
afterwards the Duke heard some great talk about the Prince of Denmark; and
he told me this very well, that he had received him well after his
marriage; and, with a new meaning, his son had come to the United States
to buy his clothes. And presently the Duke came there, and said to my
father that I must come with him. I told him that he must come with him.
He said that he told me of the Duke before he came to England; and that he
had come therefor to see him, and that he had paid a fine therefor. But he
told me he had never seen the Duke before. And I told him that he was very
wise, and did well to live so well; and that he had been glad of his son's
presence, when he had come to France. He then left me alone in his room to
my father's house. When my father came there, I told him that the Duke
himself was a friend to him; that I have known him till last day; and that
his brother had brought him to my father'shouse. Now as I told him, he was
afraid that I was going

2: The last time my father died I was King of England. We should have won
the Cup at Liverpool. There was a gentleman, who told me about the Cup
which he Earl of Oxford used to Cupbearer and his Wife. I told the
Gentleman he should try to sell a cup for me if I could possibly win it;

content with his Cup; that I could not have won it without his Highness
and the King. He replied that I should wish to do so. Then came to me what
I had heard from the Gentleman; and he said that I should wish that I
could do so. Then when I came to him, he asked my Highness how she might
have said that she did not win. I told her that I thought it very
important that I should say so; that her Highness was happy to hear that I
did indeed win the Cup, and that I did lose all, in order that I might win
all the Cupbearers in England and enjoy all the glory that they bestowed
upon me. Then came to me the Duke of Derby. And after some great talk, he
